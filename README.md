# Pizza Project

#### First Java/JS project using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for Epicodus, O7.16.2017

#### By _**{List of contributors}**_

## Description

This website has an index page with a simple pizza business  I've used Javascript and JS on the backend, when clicking on the "Calculate my cost" the user will receive a reply of the designer pizza cost based on size and toppings.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* This should work with the gh-pages provided by GitHub


## Known Bugs

I have had some difficulty with my coding, I have tried to simplify the code in order to make it work and I'm not getting the results I wish to have for the users experience. I've set up the business logic using prototype and constructors but I did not get this code to execute properly.  I've also encountered a problem with my footer.  It does not page up like it's supposed to.  I've had a difficult time with the containers lining up properly this took a bit of rearranging to line up.  I did not have enough time to create a separate page for the "regular" menu that I was hoping to setup.

## Support and contact details

Should you have any problems feel free to contact me with questions, ideas or concerns. I encourage you to make a contribution to the code.
